# c-crumbs

Small pieces of standalone ANSI C code that you can use in your programs simply by grabbing the desired .h file and #including it from your C or C++ code, inspired by Sean Barrett's [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) libraries.

## Contents

* aes.h: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm
* aes-gcm.h: AES Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) algorithm
* aes-mmo.h: AES Matyas-Meyer-Oseas (AES-MMO) hash function
* base64.h: base 64 encoding
* sha256.h: Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA-256)

## Usage

1. Copy the .h file you want into your program's directory
2. #include it in one of your C or C++ source code files

## Tests

sh tests/run.sh tests/*.c
